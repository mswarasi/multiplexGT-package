2.	groupTesting_1.0.0  (binary package)
3.	groupTesting_1.0.0.tar  (source package)

Note: 
1. The initial version was under review at Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation, and it's now available at CRAN: https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/groupTesting/
2. The Accepted Manuscript is also uploaded to this repository.
