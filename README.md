# groupTesting

We have developed an R package called **groupTesting** that can be used for simulating and modeling group (pooled) testing data. The binary and source versions of the package are uploaded under this repository. The documentation with examples is shown in the package vignette.

Files uploaded:
1.	groupTesting (package vignette)
2.	groupTesting_1.0.0  (binary package)
3.	groupTesting_1.0.0.tar  (source package)

**Note**: The manuscript titled "groupTesting: An R package for group testing estimation" with this package is currently under review at Communications in Statistics - Simulation and Computation.
