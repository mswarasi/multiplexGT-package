# multGT

We have developed an R package called **multGT** that can be used for simulating and modeling group (pooled) testing data involving multiple infections (i.e., pooled testing with multiplex assay). We consider general estimation techniques that can accommodate pooled testing data from multistage heirarchical testing, array testing, or any other testing protocol one can possibly have. Estimation of the parameters is performed using the maximum likelihood and Bayesian techniques. An initial version of the package is uploaded to this repository.
